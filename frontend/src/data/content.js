export const FAQS = [
  { q: "Does the government give a subsidy for commercial or industrial solar?", a: "There is no direct central capital subsidy for C&I solar. The PM Surya Ghar subsidy is residential-only. C&I customers instead benefit from Accelerated Depreciation (Section 32), state incentives (e.g. electricity duty exemptions) and the Green Open Access framework." },
  { q: "How much roof area do I need?", a: "As a rule of thumb, about 100 sq ft of shadow-free roof supports roughly 1 kW of solar. A 500 kW plant needs roughly 50,000 sq ft. The calculator caps the recommended size by your available area." },
  { q: "Will my monthly savings be more than my EMI?", a: "Often yes for high-tariff, high-daytime-load businesses — but it depends on tariff, generation, project cost and loan terms. The Solar vs EMI cash-flow view shows exactly when savings exceed EMI." },
  { q: "What is the typical payback period?", a: "Indicatively 3–6 years for strong C&I cases, but it varies with tariff, irradiation, cost and financing. The calculator computes both simple and discounted payback for your inputs." },
  { q: "Can EFL finance the whole project?", a: "EFL offers financing (indicatively up to ₹3 Cr per project) subject to credit assessment. Financing share, rate and tenure are decided during assessment — all figures on this platform are indicative." },
  { q: "Do I need ALMM-listed panels?", a: "From 1 June 2026, grid-connected, net-metered and open-access projects must use ALMM List-I modules and List-II cells. Ensure your EPC quotes ALMM-compliant equipment." },
  { q: "Are REC earnings guaranteed?", a: "No. REC eligibility, registration, issuance and price depend on project structure and CERC/state rules. Any REC value shown is indicative only." },
